# Backbase Web QA Assignment

## Description
This assessment’s goal is to measure the candidate's knowledge with test cases creation, test reporting and the ability to adapt with automation tools.

## Application Under Test
"BBlog" is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone).

General functionality
- CRUD Articles
- CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

## Deliverables
To start, please access the following web page https://qa-task.backbasecloud.com/. To access the application you can use username: candidatex and password: qa-is-cool.
Based on the previously mentioned general functionality, the following is required:
1. Create a series of manual test cases that cover one functionality of your choice. Make sure that you give detailed instructions for each test case (step preconditions, steps to execute test case, expected results, etc). You can use any format you prefer.
2. UI Automate at-least 5 (the more, the better) of the previously created test cases, preferably using a JavaScript/TypeScript framework.
Write documentation on how to run tests with the chosen tool.
3. Provide a test report for executed test cases (manual and automated)
4. In the case of finding bugs, provide a separate bug report
5. Provide an overall evaluation test report for the application (issues, risks, recommendation, etc.). Make it personal! Explain why you decided to automate what you’ve automated, why you decided to test what you’ve tested, what test strategies you decided to use and why... Summarising, guide us through your mind!


All manual deliverables should be added to a "Reports" folder in root of project.

Once you are done, push your test assignment to your fork. Please provide user **bb-qa** access to your fork and share a link to **your fork** when you are done with the assignment.
