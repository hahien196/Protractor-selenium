Below is my consumption that need to be confirmed

In Create article page:
- All text fields has minimum and maximum number of characters, and when user input over maximum characters -> display error message below text field
- All text fields accept all characters (number, lower/upper characters, special characters)
- Text fields: Title, Description and Body are required
- Tag field is not required
- When input leading and trailing spaces in text fields, all leading and trailing spaces are trimmed
- When any field is invalid, Publish Article button is disabled
- Can create article with the exact same content as existed article

In all article list: 
- List of article display orderly by Last modified date DESC; if there is no modification for article, sorted by Created date DESC
